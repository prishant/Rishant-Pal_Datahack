Here we first preprocess the train and test datset as per our need in the folder data_preprocess
Then we save the preprocessed file as train.csv and test.csv

We test out multiple models in train.ipynb, but HistGradientBoosting has best auc roc value
We use this model to get the final ouput as final_output.csv
